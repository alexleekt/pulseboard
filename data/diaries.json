    "content": "**Einstein quietly slips the cosmological constant** into his field equations to keep the universe perfectly balanced, then later disowns it as his greatest blunder. Generations pass before distant Type Ia supernovae turn up too faint for a matter-filled cosmos, forcing the constant back into the spotlight as the simplest driver of cosmic acceleration. Observers measure the stretching of supernova light-curves across billions of light-years and find the dilation factor matches general relativity’s prediction to the decimal, turning exploding stars into cosmic stopwatches. Simultaneously, relativists refine three-dimensional collapse models rooted in the same equations, pinning the maximum stable neutron-star mass near 2.2 solar masses and clarifying which progenitors must leave black holes behind. Multitude surveys fold thousands of supernova distances together with microwave-background priors and recover a dark-energy equation of state indistinguishable from Einstein’s Λ. Gravitational-wave detectors capture neutron-star mergers, their measured tidal deformability favoring a comparatively soft nuclear equation of state that tightens the collapse boundary even further. A sample of over fifteen hundred distant supernovae sharpens time-dilation precision to the percent level, leaving little room for non-expanding alternatives. Plans now target supernovae beyond redshift two, seek joint analyses with gravitational-wave standard sirens, and aim for fully three-dimensional, neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics simulations ready for the next galactic core-collapse event.\n\n\n\n",
